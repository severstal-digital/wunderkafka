## Consumer

```python
{!../examples/consumer.py!}
```

What you can (and can't see here):

-   as you probably already guessed, we may need all that serious clumsy
    security stuff
-   by the way, config is powered with
    [pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/). So you can see all
    configuration parameters for supported `librdkafka` version just in
    your IDE/text editor. No more searching with `Ctrl + F` through
    `CONFIGURATION.md` and dictionaries.
-   you may subscribe to multiple topics via single timestamp or
    timedelta (per topic definition is also supported)
-   by default, you don't need to close consumer manually (though, you
    can still do it). `atexit` is used.

More differences are on the way

## AvroConsumer

```python
{!../examples/consumer_avro.py!}
```

-   keys may be ignored, which is totally optional, but may be useful.
-   the main advantage here is that messages may be consumed with a
    batch even with avro deserialization, despite of the original API.
    It saves time. Really.

Multiple subscriptions example:

{!../../examples/consumer_avro_multiple_subscriptions.py!}

Let's move on.

## AvroProducer

Let's skip raw producer, as we can see all benefits in AvroProducer
either.

```python
{!../examples/producer_avro.py!}
```

-   instead of *producing* message we are thinking in terms of *sending*
    message. No big deal as original `produce()` is still under the
    hood, but we automatically use `poll()` for asynchronous
    communication and `flush()` to await that message is sent. This
    behaviour is hidden by `blocking` which is `False` by default.
-   by the way, `atexit` is also used here: producer will try to
    `flush()`. Nothing is guaranteed if something sudden will happen
    with process, but manual close is also in danger in that case.
-   less boilerplate with text schemas. You may also load it simply from
    files (via specific "store"), but wait for a minute, you may
    won't want to use them.

## AvroModelProducer

What if you don't believe in everything-as-code and want more dynamics?
Let's consider the next few lines:

```python
{!../examples/producer_avro_model.py!}
```

-   just like the previous example, but the schema derived from the
    model itself. `dataclasses` are also supported, thanks to
    [dataclasses-avroschema](https://pypi.org/project/dataclasses-avroschema/)!

## Conclusion

This is a simple API for "daily" usage.

You still can use original rich API of confluent-kafka if needed, but
from now you have some fast track.
