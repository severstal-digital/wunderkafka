    Das ist wunderbar!

What we are about?
------------------

- `Cloudera <https://www.cloudera.com/>`_ installation with its own schema registry
- `Apache Avroâ„¢ <https://avro.apache.org/>`_ is used
- Installation requires features which are fully supported by `librdkafka <https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka>`_, but not bundled in confluent-kafka python wheel
- Constant need to use producers and consumer, but without one-screen boilerplate
- Frequent need to consume not purely *events*, but *fairly recent events*
- Frequent need to handle a large number of events

So, that's it.

If you suffer from the same problems, you may don't need to reinvent your own wheel, you can try ours.

What about other projects?
--------------------------

Corresponding to `ASF wiki <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients#Clients-Python>`_ there are plenty of python clients.

- `confluent-kafka <https://pypi.org/project/confluent-kafka/>`_ is a de-facto standard, but doesn't work out-of-the-box for us, as mentioned above
- `Kafka Python <https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python>`_ is awesome, but not as performant as confluent-kafka
- pykafka `here <https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka>`__ and `here <https://github.com/dsully/pykafka>`__ looks unmaintained: has been archived
- `pykafkap <https://github.com/urbanairship/pykafkap>`_ has only producer and looks unmaintained: no updates since 2014
- `brod <https://github.com/datadog/brod>`_ is not maintained in favor of Kafka Python.

What's next?
------------

For now, it's a homebrew, so it lacks some of the features which may be useful outside of our use-cases.

ToDo:

- add configurations for multiple versions of librdkafka
- check against confluent installation
- add :code:`async`/:code:`await` syntax
- parallelize (de)serialization on CPU
- add distributed lock on producers
- add on-the-fly model derivation to consumer
- ???
